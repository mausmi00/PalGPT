## PalGPT

Welcome to PalGPT, a messaging platform built using **Next.js**, **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. This app allows you to have real time conversations with your friends just like Messenger or WhatsApp.

But that's not all! PalGPT offers a unique twist by allowing you to chat with pre-existing agents such as Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Socrates, Jeon Jungkook, and more. Alternatively, unleash your creativity by creating your very own custom AI agentâ€”just provide a prompt!

Under the hood, PalGPT implements robust data management and secure authentication through **Prisma**, **MongoDB**, and **NextAuth**. Real-time communication is seamlessly integrated using **Pusher**, while **Langcahin** and **GPT-3** allow us to have intelligent and engaging conversations!
